        <p>1. Choose a training system/Experience<br>
            2. Choose the target Function<br>
            3. Representation of the target function ( Linear Function / Decision Trees (DT) / Gradient Descent (GD)
            etc.. // All called as Hypothesis )<br>
            4. Choosing function approximation algorithm to infer the target function
        </p>
        <p>An approximation algorithm is an algorithm that provides an approximate solution to a computational problem,
            often in situations where finding an exact solution is computationally infeasible or impractical.<br>

            Approximation algorithms provide a way to find a solution that is guaranteed to be within a certain range or
            factor of the optimal solution.
        </p>
        <p>Example : <b>Find the smallest sand in a pull of sand/ find the smallest dust particle on your table</b>
        </p>
        <h4>Choose a training system/Experience</h4>
        <p>First design challange we face is to choose the type of training experience (Knowledge) from which our system
            will learn
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>1.Direct learning <br>
                    2.In-direct learning
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <div id="example" style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px;">Example from Checker game <br>/
                    Learning from Class Vs Friend </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style=" margin-top: 30px;">Note : Learning from direct training feedback is typically easier than learning
            from indirect
            feedback<br><br>
            A second important attribute of the training experience is the <b> degree to which</b> the learner controls
            the <b>sequence of training / target knowledge</b> .<br><br>
            A third important attribute of the training experience is how well it represents the <b>distribution of
                examples</b> over which the final <b>system performance(P)/learning mechanism</b> must be measured
        </p><br>
        <p>In order to complete the design of the learning system, we must decide on :<br>
        <p style="margin-left: 90px;"> <b>
                1. The exact type of knowledge to be learn <br>
                2. A representation for this target knowledge <br>
                3. A learning mechanism
            </b></p>
        </p>
        <h4>Choose the target Function :</h4>
        <p>The program needs only to learn <b> how to choose the best move from among these legal moves</b>.<br><br>
            B -> M to indicate that this function accepts as input any board from the set of legal board states B
            (b1+b2+…..+bn) and produces as output some move from the set of legal moves M (m1+m2+…..+mn) <br><br>
            1.if b is a final board state that is won, then V(b) = 100 <br>
            2.if b is a final board state that is lost, then V(b) = -100 <br>
            3.if b is a final board state that is drawn, then V(b) = 0 <br>
            4.if b is a not a final state in the game, then V(b) = V(b'), where b' is the best final board state that
            can be achieved starting from b and playing optimally until the end of the game (assuming the opponent plays
            optimally, as well). <br><br>
            Nonoperational definition : for a particular board state requires (case 4)
            searching ahead for the optimal line of play, all the way to the end of the game but
            is not efficiently computable so called as Nonoperational definition.
        </p>
        <h4>Representation of target Function :</h4>
        <p>x1: the number of black pieces on the board <br>
            x2: the number of red pieces on the board <br>
            x3: the number of black kings on the board <br>
            x4: the number of red kings on the board <br>
            x5: the number of black pieces threatened by red (i.e., which can be captured on red's next turn) <br>
            X6: the number of red pieces threatened by black<br><br>

            Thus, our learning program will represent Ṽ(b) as a linear function of the form<br><br>

            <b style="margin-left: 300px;">(b) = W0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4 + w5x5 + w6x6</b><br><br>

            Where wo through W6 are numerical coefficients/weights
        </p>
        <h4>Choosing function approximation algorithm :</h4>
        <p>Let Board state = b
            Training value of board state = Vtrain(b)
            The relationship or <b> Order pair been represented </b>as : <br>(b, Vtrain(b))<br>
            Let say Black has own the game then<br>
            b = (x1 = 3 , x = 0, x3 = 1, x4 = 0, x5 = 0, x6 = 0) and V(b) = +100 or Vtrain(b) = 100<br><br>

            How do we represent the <b>complete pair</b> :<br>
            <(x1=3 , x=0, x3=1, x4=0, x5=0, x6=0),+100>


        </p>
        <h4>Estimating training Value : </h4>
        <p>Let take the example of a relay race/checker game / Chess :<br><br>

            A relay race is a type of race where teams of runners take turns to complete a course, passing a baton or
            other object between teammates at the end of each leg. The goal is for the team to complete the course as
            quickly as possible, with each runner contributing to the overall time.<br><br>

            In a typical relay race, the course is divided into equal sections, or legs, of a certain distance. Each
            team member runs one leg of the race before passing the baton to the next runner. The order in which the
            team members run is predetermined and often depends on the strengths and abilities of each runner.<br>
            <br>
            The Rule for estimating training value been represented as <br><br>

            Vtrain(b) <- v^(Successor(b)) </p>
                <h4>Adjusting the Weights :</h4><br>
                <p>
                    Vtrain(b) <- v^(Successor(b))<br> <br> Vtrain(b) -- v^(Successor(b)) =0 Achieve the target <br> <br>
                        Vtrain(b) -- v^(Successor(b)) > 0 Missed the target(Error) <br> <br>
                        Vtrain(b) -- v^(Successor(b)) < 0 Missed the target(Error) <br> <br>
                            Let say you tried 3 set and each set has 10 times / which set is the best fit / who own the
                            game <br><br>
                            E= <b>∑</b> (Vtrain(b) __ V^(successor(b)) < 0)2 </p>
                                <h4>Adjusting the Weights :
                                </h4> <br>
                                <p>LMS – Least mean square <br><br><b style=" margin-left: 80px;"> v^(b) = W0 + <b
                                            style="font-size: 200%;">wi</b>x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4 + w5x5 + w6x6
                                    </b> <br><br>
                                    Since we did not match the expectation we need to change the weight <b>w1</b> so the
                                    let the new weight be written as <br><br>
                                    Wi <- Wi + η ( Vtrain(b) __ V (Successor(b)) < 0) x1 <br><br>
                                        <b style=" margin-left: 80px;"> V^(b) = W0 + <b
                                                style="font-size: 200%;">wi</b>x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4 + w5x5 + w6x6</b>
                                </p>
