        <p>Concept learning involves <b>acquiring general concepts from specific training</b> examples. <br>

            What is binary classification = Goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes, often represented as either
            0 or 1 <br>
            What is attributes : The feature to identify the subject/Object ex : Cell phone(Size, Company, Model, Color,
            etc..) <br></p>
        <h5>What is Number of Instances : Classification type ^d
        </h5>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            For Binary classification , Classification type = 2 <br>
            For above cell phone example, number of feature is 4 <br>
            So for a Binary classification , number of Instances will be 2^4 = 16 <br>

            <b> What is Concepts :</b> concept refers to a pattern or relationship in the data that a model is
            attempting to learn and make predictions based on. A concept can be thought of as a mapping from inputs to
            outputs that defines the relationship between the features of the data and the target variable.
            <br><br>
            For example, in a <b>binary classification</b> problem, a concept might represent the relationship between a
            set of input features (such as <b> Size, company, model,</b> and color level) and the target variable
            (<b>whether or not </b>an individual is likely to <b> purchase</b> a certain product). The machine learning
            model's goal is to learn the underlying concepts in the data and use them to make accurate predictions for
            new data points. <br>

        <p><b style="color: #e15f41;">Syntactically distinct hypotheses :</b> refers to the idea that there can be
            multiple different hypotheses that have the same meaning, but are expressed using different syntax (i.e.
            sentence structure). For example, consider the following two sentences: <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The cat is on the mat. <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The mat has a cat on it. <br>
            <b> Both of these sentences have the same meaning, but they are structured differently </b>(the
            subject-verb-object order is different). In this sense, they are "syntactically distinct hypotheses.“
            <br><br>

            It's important to note that in some cases, <b> the syntax of a sentence can affect its meaning.</b>
            For example: <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe cat chased the mouse.<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe mouse was chased by the cat.<br>
            In this case, the two sentences have different meanings, as the subject-verb-object order changes the focus
            of the sentence.<br>
            In Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other areas of computer science, recognizing and working with
            syntactically distinct hypotheses can be important in tasks such as language translation, text
            classification, and question answering.<br>
        </p>
        <p> <b style="color: #e15f41">"Semantically distinct hypotheses“ :</b> refers to the idea that there can be
            multiple different hypotheses that have <b>different meanings</b>, despite having similar or identical
            syntax. In other words, the <b>meaning of the hypothesis</b> is different, even though the <b>sentence
                structure is the same</b>. <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp For example, consider the following two sentences: <br><br>

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJohn is happy. <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJohn is hungry. <br><br>

            Both sentences have the same syntax (subject-verb-predicate order), but the meaning of the sentences is
            different. In this case, "John is happy" and "John is hungry" are considered "semantically distinct
            hypotheses.“ <br><br>

            It's important to note that in many NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and question
            answering, it's important to understand the meaning of a sentence in order to perform the task effectively.
            In these cases, being able to identify semantically distinct hypotheses can be important for accurately
            determining the meaning of a sentence.

            Note : Where the "1" represents the trivial hypothesis that always predicts "no".<br><br>

            The trivial hypothesis is a term used in machine learning to refer to the simplest and most basic hypothesis
            that can be used to solve a given problem. It is called trivial because it provides the minimum amount of
            information and makes the fewest assumptions about the relationship between the input and output variables.
            <br><br>

            If we view learning as a search problem, then it is natural that our study of learning algorithms will
            examine the different strategies for searching the hypothesis space. We will be particularly interested in
            algorithms capable of efficiently searching very large or infinite hypothesis spaces, to find the hypotheses
            that best fit the training data.
