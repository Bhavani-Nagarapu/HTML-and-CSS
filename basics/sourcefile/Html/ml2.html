        <h1>What is perceptron</h1>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;">A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron used as a building
            block in neural networks. It is one of the simplest forms of a neural network model, introduced by Frank
            Rosenblatt in 1958. The perceptron is a binary classifier, which means it can distinguish between two
            classes.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: #227093;"><b>Key Components of a Perceptron:</b></h3><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;"><b style="color: #218c74; font-size: 130%;">Inputs:</b> The
            perceptron receives multiple input values, typically represented as a vector x=[x1,x2,…,xn]\mathbf{x} =
            [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]x=[x1​,x2​,…,xn​].<br><br>

            <b style="color: #218c74; font-size: 130%;">Weights:</b> Each input is associated with a weight
            w=[w1,w2,…,wn]\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n]w=[w1​,w2​,…,wn​], which indicates the importance of the
            input. The weights are adjustable parameters.<br><br>

            <b style="color: #218c74; font-size: 130%;">Bias:</b> A bias term b is added to the weighted sum of the
            inputs, allowing the model to shift the decision boundary. It can be considered as an additional input with
            a fixed value of 1.<br><br>

            <b style="color: #218c74; font-size: 130%;">Activation Function:</b> The perceptron uses an activation
            function to decide the output. The most common activation function for a perceptron is the step function,
            which outputs a binary result (0 or 1).
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: #227093;"><b>How It Works</b></h4>
        <p>1. <b>Weighted Sum:</b> The perceptron computes a weighted sum of the inputs:<br><br><b
                style="margin-left: 380px;">z=w.x+b=w1x1+w2x2+...+wnxn+b</b><br><br>
            2. <b>Activation:</b> The output is determined by applying the activation function to the weight sum. In the
            case of a step function:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/percpton.png" alt="">
        <h4 style="color: #227093;"><b>Learning Process: </b></h4>
        <p><b>Training:</b> The perceptron learns by adjusting its weights based on the error between the predicted
            output and the actual output. The weights are updated using the perceptron learning rule, which adjusts the
            weights in proportion to the error.<br>

            <b>Convergence:</b> If the data is linearly separable, the perceptron learning algorithm is guaranteed to
            converge, meaning it will find a set of weights that correctly classifies the training data.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: #227093;"><b> Limitations:</b></h4>
        <p>
            <b>Linear Separability: </b>A single-layer perceptron can only solve problems where the data is linearly
            separable. It cannot solve problems like XOR, where the classes cannot be separated by a straight line.<br>

            <b>Complexity:</b> For more complex problems, perceptrons can be combined into multi-layer networks, known
            as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which are capable of solving non-linear problems.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: #227093;"><b>Applications:</b></h4>
        <p><b>Basic Classification: </b>Early applications included simple binary classification tasks, like distinguishing between different patterns.<br>

            <b>Foundational to Neural Networks:</b> The perceptron is a foundational concept in the development of modern neural networks and deep learning models.
